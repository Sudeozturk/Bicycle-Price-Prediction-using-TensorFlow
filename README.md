# Bicycle-Price-Prediction-using-TensorFlow
This project develops a machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict bicycle prices.
The model analyzes various features of bicycles to estimate their market value. The data used in this project is entirely synthetic and not derived from real-world sources. This is my first project using TensorFlow, created for practice in machine learning. This repository contains the code, data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation metrics. It serves as a great starting point for those interested in machine learning and predictive analytics using TensorFlow.

Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training using TensorFlow
Evaluation of model performance
Visualization of results


How to use:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the data preprocessing script.
Train the model using the training script.
Evaluate the model performance.


Dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
